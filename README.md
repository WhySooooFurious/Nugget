# Getting your mobiledevicepairing file
AltStore should automatically give you a pairing file. If it doesn't or you are using another signing service, use the following steps:
1. Download `jitterbugpair` for your system from here: <https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/latest>
**Note:** On mac or linux, you may have to run the terminal command `chmod +x ./jitterbugpair` in the same directory.
2. Run the program by either double clicking it or using terminal/powershell
3. Share the `.mobiledevicepairing` file to your iOS device
4. Open the app and select the pairing file

You should only have to do this once unless you lose the file and delete the app's data.

# Setting Up WireGuard
1. Download [WireGuard](<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209>) on the iOS App Store.
2. Download [SideStore's config file](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/download/0.1.1/sidestore.conf) on your iOS device
3. Share the config file to WireGuard using the share menu
4. Enable it and run Nugget
